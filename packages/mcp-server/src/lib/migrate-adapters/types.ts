/**
 * Migration adapter pattern — Plan 9 Phase E.
 *
 * A {@link MigrationSource} represents one supported "source" project
 * shape (e.g. the Hubdustry Go MCP server, a legacy discord-bot config).
 * Each adapter knows how to:
 *
 *   1. {@link MigrationSource.detect} — answer "is this filesystem a
 *      project I understand?" without throwing on missing files.
 *   2. {@link MigrationSource.migrate} — walk the source tree and emit
 *      a {@link MigrationResult} listing tools mapped onto discord-mcp,
 *      tools that have no equivalent yet (`unmappedTools`), and items
 *      that need a human eye (`manualReview`).
 *
 * The `migrate` command iterates this pattern: it never imports an
 * adapter implementation directly — it only consumes the registry in
 * `./index.ts`. Plan 11 will add Discord-using adapters
 * (PaSympa / quadslab / discord-ops / barryyip) without touching this
 * type or the command surface.
