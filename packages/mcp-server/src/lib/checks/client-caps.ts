/**
 * `client-caps` check — Plan 9 Phase B.
 *
 * Reports the MCP capabilities discord-mcp ADVERTISES at server boot.
 * This is OFFLINE-only — actual client capability negotiation happens
 * during the MCP `initialize` handshake, which doctor cannot observe
 * without spawning the server. The list below mirrors what
 * `mcp-server/src/server.ts` registers on the SDK Server instance.
 *
 * Always status='ok'. Functions as a self-describing "what does this
 * server support?" for users wiring into a new MCP client.
