# Resilience — Operator Guide

`discord-mcp` wraps every Discord REST call in a composite resilience
policy: **retry → 429-aware delay → circuit breaker → bulkhead →
timeout**. Each layer is configurable via environment variables. This
document explains what the defaults are, when to override them, and
how the layers interact.

---

## Retry

Retries are ON by default with exponential backoff + jitter.

| Var | Default | Range | Notes |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| `MCP_RETRY_ENABLED` | `true` | bool | Set to literal `false` to disable. |
| `MCP_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | 1–10 | Total tries (NOT extra retries). `3` means: 1 attempt + up to 2 retries. |
| `MCP_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS` | `200` | 50–5000 | Starting backoff. |
| `MCP_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS` | `10000` | 500–60000 | Cap for exponential growth. |
| `MCP_RETRY_JITTER` | `full` | `none` / `full` / `decorrelated` | `full` ≈ AWS recommendation. |

**What retries**: 5xx, network errors, request timeouts, and
explicit-Discord transient codes.

**What does NOT retry**: 4xx client errors (bad input, missing
permissions, not-found). These bubble straight up as structured
errors so the agent can correct itself rather than burn rate-limit
headroom on a request that will never succeed.

### When to override

- **Aggressive dev loop** (low latency, fail fast):
  `MCP_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=1` `MCP_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS=50`.
  No retries means the first failure surfaces immediately.
- **Conservative prod**:
  `MCP_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=4` `MCP_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS=500`
  `MCP_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS=20000`. Higher attempt count + longer cap
  protects against extended Discord outages without thrashing.
- **Long-running bulk operations** (e.g. bulk-ban, archive sweep):
  consider raising `MCP_TIMEOUT_LONG_MS` rather than retry count —
  the operation that's already in flight is more valuable than
  starting over.

## 429 (rate limit) handling

Discord rate-limit responses (`HTTP 429`) carry a `retry_after`
header (in seconds, may be fractional). The resilience pipeline
honors it directly: when a 429 fires, the next retry waits **at
least** `retry_after` seconds (plus jitter) before re-issuing.

Two scopes:

- **Per-route**: routes in Discord are bucketed by major parameters
  (e.g. `/channels/:id/messages` is bucketed by `channel_id`). Hitting
  the per-route limit pauses only that route.
- **Global**: `X-RateLimit-Global: true` is treated the same way —
  pause and respect `retry_after`. Global hits are rare and almost
  always indicate a bug (e.g. tight loop without yielding).

Both surface a `mcp.tool.errors` increment with `error_code:
"rate_limited"` if all retries are exhausted; a single 429 followed
by a successful retry is invisible at the audit/error layer (counted
in metrics as a normal call).

There is no separate env var for 429 behavior — it's gated by
`MCP_RETRY_ENABLED` and bounded by `MCP_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`. Setting
attempts to 1 turns 429 retry off (the call surfaces immediately).

---

## Timeouts

Two budgets:

| Var | Default | Range | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `MCP_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_MS` | `30000` | 1000–120000 | Per-call ceiling for the standard REST path. |
| `MCP_TIMEOUT_LONG_MS` | `60000` | 1000–300000 | For tools annotated as `long-running` (bulk/sweep ops). |

Timeout fires AFTER retry — i.e. each individual attempt can take up
to the timeout, then the policy retries (until `MAX_ATTEMPTS` is
reached). The total wall-clock budget for a tool call is roughly
`MAX_ATTEMPTS * TIMEOUT_MS + sum(backoffs)`. With defaults: ~95
seconds worst case for the standard path.

**Recommendation**:

- Dev: `MCP_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_MS=10000` to surface hangs quickly.
- Prod: keep defaults unless you've measured Discord P99 latency for
  your specific routes.

## Circuit breaker

Once a route has failed `MCP_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` times in a
sliding window, the circuit opens and **fast-rejects** subsequent
calls without hitting Discord. After `MCP_CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN_AFTER_MS`,
the breaker enters half-open: the next call probes the upstream; if
it succeeds the circuit closes, otherwise it re-opens.

| Var | Default | Range | Notes |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| `MCP_CIRCUIT_ENABLED` | `true` | bool | Set literal `false` to disable. |
| `MCP_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | `10` | 3–100 | Failures before opening. |
| `MCP_CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN_AFTER_MS` | `60000` | 5000–600000 | Recovery probe delay. |

**When to override**:

- Disable in unit/integration tests where you want failures to bubble
  immediately: `MCP_CIRCUIT_ENABLED=false`.
- High-volume prod: bump `MCP_CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=25` to reduce
  noise from sporadic transients.
- Aggressive recovery: lower `MCP_CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN_AFTER_MS=15000`
  if you're confident upstream issues clear quickly.

The breaker is per-route, not global. A flapping `/messages` endpoint
won't trip `/channels`.

---

## Bulkhead (concurrency limit)

The bulkhead semaphore caps **in-flight Discord REST calls** across
all tools. When the limit is reached, new calls **fast-reject** with
`error_code: "bulkhead_saturated"` rather than queueing — head-of-line
blocking is worse than a clear "back off" signal.

| Var | Default | Range | Notes |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| `MCP_BULKHEAD_LIMIT` | `100` | 1–1000 | Max concurrent in-flight REST calls. |

**Minimum sane value: 10.** The internal pipeline tool can spawn
sub-tools that issue REST calls; a bulkhead of 1 deadlocks instantly
because the parent holds a slot waiting for the child. We document
this rather than enforce a runtime minimum so test fixtures with
limit=1 still work for unit tests that never recurse.

**Sizing**: Discord allows ~50 requests/second per bot to most routes.
A bulkhead of 100 is generous and rarely hits in practice unless
the agent is making bulk parallel tool calls. Tighten to 20–30 if
you want a clear early signal of "agent is over-parallelizing".

---

## Pipeline + bulkhead interaction

The `mcp_pipeline` meta-tool composes other tools serially or in
parallel. **Each leaf tool that hits Discord acquires a bulkhead
slot.** If your pipeline fans out to 50 children that each issue 2
REST calls, you can briefly exceed 100 in-flight REST calls; the
bulkhead will kick in and the over-spilled calls return
`bulkhead_saturated`, which the pipeline propagates back up as a
partial-result with the failed children flagged.

Bottom line: pipelines do NOT amplify the bulkhead — they share it.
This is intentional. If you raise `MCP_BULKHEAD_LIMIT`, you're also
raising the pipeline's effective fan-out before saturation.

---

## Order of operations

```
caller → bulkhead → circuit → 429-aware retry → timeout → Discord REST
```

Read top-down: a call is admitted by the bulkhead, then checked against
the circuit, then dispatched through the retry policy (which honors
429s and times out individual attempts).

If you stack the layers in a different mental model, debugging
becomes confusing — keep this picture in mind when reading
`packages/mcp-core/src/rest/policy.ts`.

## Reference table

| Layer | Default behavior | Disable how |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Retry | 3 attempts, exponential w/ full jitter | `MCP_RETRY_ENABLED=false` or `MCP_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=1` |
| 429 retry-after | Honored, capped by retry budget | (gated by retry) |
| Timeout | 30s default, 60s long | (no toggle — set ms to max range) |
| Circuit | 10 failures → open 60s | `MCP_CIRCUIT_ENABLED=false` |
| Bulkhead | 100 in-flight, fast-reject | `MCP_BULKHEAD_LIMIT=1000` (effectively off for normal load) |
